# ZIPF

[![Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/zipf/badge/)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/zipf/badge/)

## What does it do?
It builds a zipf out of a directory of files, using multiprocessing since with large amounts of files the process can be very long.

## How much time does it take to process?
Well, I created a zipf of about 1M text webpages and it took about 10 minutes. For 4k pages it takes about 2 seconds.

## How do I use it?
A documentation will soon be publised.
