The zipf package was realized to simplify creations and operations with zipf distributions.

Currently it is possible to create a zipf from:

* A list.
* A text.
* A text file.
* An url to a webpage.
* A directory containing one or more directories containing text files.

It is also possible to calculate in batch operations like the `Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence (JSD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence>`_.
